The triple bottom line should be an integrative process that takes into consideration decision making and design, along with impacts on the community and built environment.

By looking at a problem as a small part of a larger system, it is easier for a person to see all of the interrelated parts that may contribute to or be affected by the problem, thereby making it easier to solve. The system can represent a building project, organization, community, or city. Systems thinking is an important part of the integrative process. A fundamental concept in systems thinking is that by examining the interaction and connections between all the parts of a system, each part can be better understood. Another concept is that an improvement in one part of a system may have a negative effect on another part of the same system. The goal of systems thinking in organizations is communication across all levels of the organization so that a solution in one area does not result in a problem in another area.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c9"><span></span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_list_1-0"><li class="c5 c2"><span class="c6">An open system is a system in which materials and resources continually enter the system through extraction, are consumed, and then are removed from the system as waste. For example, resources such as food and water are brought into homes, consumed, and then discarded into sewers and landfill s. These materials and resources have an end life. Open systems are linear and are not considered sustainable in the traditional sense.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c9"><span></span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_list_1-0"><li class="c5 c2"><span class="c6">A closed system is a cyclical system in which material s and resources are consumed and then reused or recycled. For exan1ple, dead and decaying plants become fertilizer, which helps other plants grow. Closed systems are considered sustainable because no waste is produced. There is no end life. Just like the closed systems in nature, the goal for sustainable systems in green buildings is to continually reuse and recycle materials and resources.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c9"><span></span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_list_1-0"><li class="c5 c2"><span class="c6">With a negative feedback loop, systems self-correct and stay within a particular set of parameters. An output may signal to the system to stop changing. For example, when a room gets too warm, a signal from a thermostat is sent to a controller to turn on the air conditioner. When the room reaches a preset temperature, another signal is sent from the thermostat to turn off the air conditioner.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c9"><span></span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_list_1-0"><li class="c5 c2"><span class="c6">With a positive feedback loop, the output of a system is applied to the input, resulting in constant increases. Population growth is an example of a positive feedback loop. The more people that are born, the more people there are to bear more people.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c9"><span></span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_list_1-0"><li class="c5 c2"><span class="c6">A leverage point is a point in a system in which a small change can yield large results. For example, when building occupants are provided with energy-use data, many will instinctively change their energy-use behavior. This results in a significant reduction of energy use throughout the building. This type of leverage point is also an example of the &quot; Prius effect.&quot;</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c8 c14"><span></span></p></body></html>
